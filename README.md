GeoAI-Retail is an [opinionated](https://medium.com/@stueccles/the-rise-of-opinionated-software-ca1ba0140d5b) analysis template striving to streamline and promote use of best practices for projects combining Geography and Artificial Intelligence for retail through a logical, reasonably standardized, and flexible project structure. A high level overview of the methods implemented in GeoAI-Retail is discussed in the [Customer-Centric Analysis StoryMap](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/76006dd166294e6fae7e6164a1ff0a4a). 

GeoAI-Retail is an adaptation of GeoAI-Cookiecutter tailored for  retail analysis workflows. GeoAI-Cookiecutter grew out of a need within the Advanced Analytics team at Esri to streamline project bootstrapping, encourage innovation, increase repeatability, encourage documentation, and encourage best practices based on [strong opinions (best practices)](https://knu2xs.github.io/geoai-retail#opinions). GeoAI-Retail implements these opinions with additional tight integration to the Esri Business Analyst extension capabilities heavily relying functionality from the [BA-Tools Python package](https://anaconda.org/knu2xs/ba-tools). This enables a data driven approach to model the relationship between who and where customers are, and customers' relationships to physical store locations using artificial intelligence. 

## Requirements to use the cookiecutter template:
 * ArcGIS Pro 2.4 or greater (Python 3.6 and Conda come with it)
 * [Cookiecutter](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 1.4.0

``` bash
> conda install -c conda-forge cookiecutter
```


## To start a new project, run:

``` bash
> cookiecutter https://github.com/ArcGIS/geoai-cookiecutter
```
